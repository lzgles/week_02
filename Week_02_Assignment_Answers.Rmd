This assignment is due by 6 pm on the evening of the 3rd class. 

#### Textbook

-   Review from this past week:
    
    
- Prepare for next week:
    

#### Additional Readings

-   [*Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/)

    -   Chapters 15-19

#### Supplemental Readings

*Note: these are not required, but may be helpful for you to better understand the work.*

-   [A layered grammar of graphics](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html)

#### Exercises

1.  Install the `nycflights13` package and load it into the namespace of your R session. Also, load the `tidyverse` package into the namespace of your R session. Attach the `airlines`, `airports`, `flights`, `weather`, and `planes` datasets

```{r}
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
data("airlines", "airports", "flights", "weather", "planes")
```

2.  We'll begin by exploring the `flights` dataset. Determine the following information about the dataset.

-   Structure
-   Dimensions
-   Summary Statistics for each column

```{r}
str(flights)
dim(flights); nrow(flights); ncol(flights)
summary(flights)
```

3.  We'll be concentrating on a few key fields. Use the vignette about the `flights` table to look up the definitions of the following fields:

-   `dep_delay` & `arr_delay`
-   `hour` & `minute`
-   `origin`

Copy those definitions as a response here.

```{r}
# dep_delay, arr_delay
# Departure and arrival delays, in minutes. Negative times represent early departures/arrivals.
# 
# origin, dest
# Origin and destination. See airports for additional metadata.
```

4.  Create a bar chart that demonstrates which origin occurs most frequently. Write a short interpretation of the bar graph.

```{r}
flights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = origin)) +
  geom_bar()
```

5.  What is the distribution of flight departure times by hour? Describe the plot that you created.

    *Hint: Consider different geometries when creating the graph. Histograms are usually a good place to start when considering distributions, but bar plots can be helpful as well.*

```{r}
flights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour)) +
  geom_bar()
```

6.  How does the distribution change when we consider the origin of the flight? Build upon your response in question 5. Describe the differences.

    *Hint: Experiment with faceting to find a view that is most helpful.*

```{r}
flights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_grid(origin ~ .)
```


7.  How does departure hour interact with departure delay? Utilize a [boxplot](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-boxplots-5e2df7bcbd51). Interpret the graph.

    *Hint: It can be helpful to adjust the portion of the graph that you observe in order to find patterns. Consider using `coord_cartesian` to help with this.*

```{r}
flights %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = hour,
             y = dep_delay,
             group = hour)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-50, 100))
```

8.  Create your own question and answer it by using a graph. You may use any of the datasets loaded in the `nycflights13` package.

-   Indicate what your question is. Consider a question that could be answered best by utilizing facets, multiple geometries, multiple aesthetics, or some combination of those.
-   Create a graph that assists in answering the question.
-   Write a short interpretation of the graph in order to answer your question.

9.  You have now built a variety of graphics using the `ggplot2` system. Describe some of the advantages to the "grammar of graphics" approach to creating graphs.
